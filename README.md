## CoinSpider

This tool was designed primarily to learn [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/),
a Javascript library based on the [model-view-presenter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter)
application design paradigm (yes, i'm a geek person).

Besides due to my huge interest in [crypto-currencies](http://coinmarketcap.com/), I found it appropriate
to initiate a project involving these two subjects.

So here we are: A tool based on HTML and Javascript (you can run it in your own computer)
that help you track the current value of the most important crypto-currencies on the market.

If you like what I'm doing and you want to motivate me to create/improve features,
